	<h3>Adamn Killa - Back 2 Ballin</h3>
	<p>Adamn got a bit of buzz recently by hopping on several tracks with Yung Lean, and dropping a killer tape with Blank Body titled Libra Season last year. Production on Back 2 Ballin is handled primarily by Blank Body again, but also features DJ Smokey, Dolan Beats, and more, ending with one helluva track by Shlohmo. Adamn, a Chicago native, raps with a flow reminiscent of Chief Keef, which weaves surprisingly well into the beats selected for the project.</p>

	<h3>Aesop Rock - The Impossible Kid</h3>

	<p>The underground legend returns with yet another brilliant album to get lost in for hours. If you know Aesop’s music, you likely know how cryptic his lyrics can be. This time around, he has stripped that approach back a wee bit, and addresses issues ranging from his mental health, the death of fellow rapper and friend Camu, and his family more head-on than ever.</p>

	<h3>airøspace - 戦場ヶ原 ひたぎ [vol. III]</h3>
	<p>Another hip-hop album from Anthony Alexander, who also drums in the metal/post-hardcore band Louder Than Quiet. Airo’s newest release manages to balance complex rhyme schemes over smooth beats and MC Ride style shouts over harsh electronic sounds. Vol II is also worth checking out if you like this project. </p>

	<h3>Azizi Gibson - A New Life</h3>
	
	<p>Azizi has been consistently putting out great material since 2011, and manages to make each project he drops sound different. With his newest release, A New Life, this remains true. A truly cohesive effort revolving around watching anime, female anatomy, and braggadocio complimented by some superb production.</p>

	<h3>Bladee - Eversince</h3>

	<p>A superb followup to 2014 release GLUEE. Bladee is at the top of his game here, casually belting out autotune-assisted rap ballads over airy, cold beats. Production is handled exclusively by Sad Boys/Gravity Boys in-house producer Whitearmor. Bladee really hits his stride in the second half, going on a seven-track run of absolute brilliance.  </p>

	<h3>Casey Veggies - Customized Greatly 4</h3>

	<p>Casey returns with another mixtape in the Customized Greatly series, serving as a followup to his 2015 album Live & Grow. This tape boasts an all-star lineup of producers and features. I personally enjoyed this mixtape more than last years album. Casey put together a well polished contemporary west coast effort. </p>

	<h3>Denzel Curry - Imperial</h3>
	
	<p>A free album that exceeded my expectations this year. Denzel’s been throwing some absolutely unreal flows over sinister beats for a while now, but his last project was a disappointment to me (too much filler). He returns full force with insanely clean production weaving in perfectly under the rapid-fire bars one has come to expect from Curry. </p>

	<h3>Derin Falana - Live From Rocky Mountain</h3>
	
	<p>Derin has a voice like a young, more upbeat Drake. His newest effort is a cohesive and insanely enjoyable project. A nice mix of slower R&B tinged tracks and fun summer anthems. Derin has a lot of potential, and I look forward to his future projects. </p>

	<h3>Dillon & Paten Locke - Food Chain</h3>

	<p>Rapper Dillon once again teams up with producer Paten Locke to create some gorgeous old school sounds. Dillon spits some intricate rhymes with a laid back style that can evoke thoughts of MF Doom.  </p>

	<h3>Elucid - Save Yourself</h3>
	
	<p>Elucid came onto my radar last year after a righteous feature on Milo's So the Flies Don’t Come. He rocks the quintessential modern NYC underground rap style. Gritty beats, vocals that seem barely able to restrain some apparent frustration. I could definitely see this album ending up in my top 10 hip-hop releases for the year.</p>

	<h3>Father - I’m a Piece of Shit</h3>

	<p>Father described this record as “The melancholy result of all my fucked-up decisions,” which seems like a perfect follow up to the “32 minutes of pure, unfiltered debauchery” on his 2015 LP Who’s Gonna Get Fucked First? I’m a Piece of Shit is far more mellow than the standard Father project. Overall, it’s a great addition to his catalog, and it’s great to see him diversify his style even further.</p>

	<h3>Jazz Cartier - Hotel Paranoia</h3>
	
	<p>Jacuzzi La Fleur drops a superb follow up to 2015 release Marauding in Paradise. Hotel Paranoia features some absolute heaters, some gorgeous slow tracks, an overall dark ambiance, and minimal filler. A very reasonable use of autotune appears from time to time, which, for better or worse, ends up drawing a lot of comparisons to Travi$ Scott’s vocals. I’m really excited to see what Cartier does next. </p>

	<h3>Joey Purp - iiiDrops</h3>
	
	<p>Chicago has been churning out so many great artists in recent years. Joey Purp is a member of the Savemoney crew with Chance the Rapper, and also one half of Leather Corduroys with Kami de Chukwu. This solo effort is an excellent showcase of Joey’s skills; both soulful and braggadocios, and includes features from many of his rapping pals. Purp definitely deserves more attention, and hopefully this project will really put him on the map.</p>

	<h3>Jega - Variance</h3>
	<h5>IDM </h5>
	<p>Rough version of this record leaked back in ‘03. Jega went back and remade the entire album, dropping the new version in '09 as a double disc. Nice old school electronic feel, like a more coherent Aphex Twin. Highly recommend.</p>

	<h3>The Kleenrz - Season Two</h3>

	<p>The Kleenrz is the collaborative efforts of rapper Self Jupiter and producer Kenny Segal. They describe the album as a “dark film noir” release, which seems entirely accurate. It reminds me a lot of L'Orange & Jeremiah Jae’s project The Night Took Us in Like Family from last year. Segal’s production always has a great organic feel to it. Jupiter has the perfect voice for the film noir style. </p>

	<h3>Le$ - E36: Techno Violet</h3>

	<p>A five song EP from Jet Life affiliate Le$, with four of the five tracks being over ten minutes each. E36 was inspired by the movie Drive, and samples from the movie soundtrack appear throughout. Some great Houston car raps, with plenty of very fluid beat switches. One of my favorite EP’s from this year.</p>

	<h3>Lil West - Indigo 2</h3>
	
	<p>Lil West is an 18 year old rapper out of Delaware. Indigo 2 is full of murky, dark production from Elijah Wiley. West spits surprisingly hype bars and infectious hooks throughout the five tracks on the project. This EP is a big step up from his previous efforts.</p>

	<h3>Lil Yachty - Lil Boat</h3>
	
	<p>I can’t even understand why I like this tape so much. Yachty just has such an oddly endearing style. Lil Boat is a wild ride, featuring woozy bangers, some of the catchiest hooks I’ve heard all year, and genuinely fun tracks. A fair amount of the production is handled by rapper/producer Burberry Perry. Yachty’s distinct, congested voice pairs well with the poppy piano riffs and spacious beats that appear throughout the tape. </p>

	<h3>Lorde Fredd33 - Dead Man’s View</h3>
	
	<p>Fredd33 has been putting out some really great projects for the past couple of years that totally flew under the radar. Production is handled exclusively by Q the Sun, who creates a spectral atmosphere to compliment Fredd33’s deep, heavy-hitting voice. Hauntingly beautiful, occasionally soulful, and altogether magnificent. I wouldn’t be surprised if this ended up in my top five hip-hop releases for the year. </p>

	<h3>Nessly - Still Finessin</h3>
	
	<p>Nessly gained some recognition with the bizarre lean ballad Crying in Codeine. A product of the Atlanta underground and the internet, Ness comes through with an enjoyable, very topical record. It may be derivative, but he’s clearly on the way to finding his own sound in the over-saturated Atlanta scene. And damn, the kid can make some hot tracks. </p>

	<h3>Oddisee - Alwasta</h3>

	<p>Producer and occasional rapper Oddisee dropped this tape in March, and quickly followed it up with a fantastic instrumental release; The Odd Tape. The Brooklyn MC sing-raps with both skill and heartfelt care. As always, the production is incredibly well composed on its own, and works dynamically with his raps. An ideal record to sit with during your Sunday morning coffee.</p>

	<h3>Open Mike Eagle - Hella Personal Film Festival</h3>

	<p>Mike gives us another album full of hilarious self awareness. Production is handled by Paul White, and is a huge departure from his last two releases. While the raps and beats are both great alone, they don’t always mesh together well. With that said, I think that there are enough great moments on this album that more than make up for the occasional blunders. It’s a fun, lighthearted record that will give you a few laughs along the way. </p>

	<h3>Skepta - Konnichiwa</h3>
	
	<p>As grime continues to find its way over the pond, Skepta drops his fourth studio album. The Boy Better Know co-founder fires out harsh bars over harsher beats, with a handful of softer tracks thrown in for good measure. Features range from Pharrell to fellow BBK co-founder (and brother) JME. Aside from the insanely uninteresting phone call skits tacked onto several tracks, it’s an excellent high energy release.    </p>

	<h3>Spark Master Tape - Silhouette of a Sunkken City</h3>
	
	<p>Three years after his last release, the anonymous rapper returns with another high quality release. Deep voice pitch, lyrics that ride a fine line between complete ignorance and existential awareness, and absolutely wild production (there’s a beat built entirely around a sample of a blowjob). Weighing in with a hefty 22 tracks it’s a lot to digest, but it’s enjoyable as hell.</p>

	<h3>Tripsixx - We Own the Night</h3>
	<h5>Glitch Hop, Breakbeat </h5>
	<p>Another up-and-comer from the Toronto scene, Tripsixx gives us a well curated five track EP, striking a balance between OVO style crooning and downtempo heaters. More diverse than the standard projects coming out of Toronto currently.</p>

	<h3>Tunji Ige - Missed Calls</h3>
	
	<p>Tunji made some waves in 2014 with a remix of his track Day2Day featuring ILoveMakonnen and Michael Christmas. This year, he returns with his second project, Missed Calls. It’s a smooth, more refined effort. Lush, polished production with a well balanced blend of singing and rapping. Definitely a standout EP for the year. </p>

	<h3>Yung Lean - Warlord</h3>
	<h5>Drone, Experimental </h5>
	<p>The Swedish rapper returns with his third effort. Lean and his incredible production team explore plenty of new sonic territory while managing to create a mostly cohesive and intricate release. There are hints of punk, noise, and Chicago trap; all while the distinct cold tinge from Unknown Memory lurks ominously in the background. The progression from Unknown Death 2002 back in 2013 to now has been incredible to watch.</p>
